  This software is a proof-of-concept on how to use a dettached UI which gets data
  from a backend via an API serving JSON.

  In this case we are displaying locations which accept Faircoins.


  The backend is currently an independent OCP (valuenetwork (*)) install using GraphQL
  to serve the frontend, made in Ionic 4 which is great for mobile apps.

  Here we display the GeoLocation of the user (you!) so you can easily find who accept
  Faircoins around you.

  It's more recommended and reasonable to try it on your phone with GPS activated.



  This was done in collaboration with several FairCoop members and is open for ideas,
  feature requests, pull requests (mostly!), and contributions (See contributors tab)

  WARNING: this is alpha software and might not work well on every browser yet.

  There is the option to build this as a mobile app, where GeoLocation works
  much more reliably than with regular browsers.
